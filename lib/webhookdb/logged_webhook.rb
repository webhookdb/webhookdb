  # Trim logged webhooks to keep this table to a reasonable size.
  # The current trim algorithm and rationale is:
  #
  # - Logs that belong to inserts that were not part of an org are for our internal use only.
  #   They usually indicate an integration that was misconfigured, or is for an org that doesn't exist.
  #   We keep these around for 2 weeks (they are always errors since they have no org).
  #   Ideally we investigate and remove them before that.
  #   We may need to 'block' certain opaque ids from being logged in the future,
  #   if for example we cannot get a client to turn off a misconfigured webhook.
  # - Successful webhooks get their contents (request body and headers)
  #   _truncated_ after 7 days (but the webhook row remains).
  #   Usually we don't need to worry about these so in theory we can avoid logging verbose info at all.
  # - Successful webhooks are deleted entirely after 90 days.
  #   Truncated webhooks are useful for statistics,
  #   but we can remove them earlier in the future.
  # - Failed webhooks get their contents truncated after 30 days,
  #   but the webhook row remains. We have a longer truncation date
  #   so we have more time to investigate.
  # - Error webhooks are deleted entirely after 90 days.
